# Aim: 

To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation
# Algorithm: 

Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate video content (e.g., animations, visual effects, video summaries) using AI models. 
## Procedure:
Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models:
Begin by exploring AI tools capable of video generation from text prompts. Popular models for video generation include:
Runway Gen-2#
Synthesia
Pictory
DeepBrain
Understand the capabilities and limitations of each tool before starting the experiment.
Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation:
Start with simple prompts to generate short videos. These prompts should describe the general subject or activity.
Example prompt: "A person walking in a park."
Experiment with More Detailed Prompts:
Gradually refine your prompts by adding specific details, such as the setting, lighting, actions, or expressions.
Example prompt: "A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them."
Add Time and Motion Elements:
Incorporate aspects like timing, transitions, or camera movement in your prompts.
Example prompt: "A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky."
Test Different Video Styles:
Experiment with different styles of video generation, such as animations, live-action, cinematic, or artistic.
Example prompt: "An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people."
Iterate and Adjust Prompts:
Evaluate the generated video and refine the prompt if needed. Consider aspects like the pacing, transitions, and consistency of motion in the video.
Example: After reviewing, refine the prompt to add more details about the camera angles or actions: "A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene."
Generate Multiple Versions:
Generate multiple versions of the same prompt with slight variations to compare how the video output differs based on the phrasing of the prompt.
Save and Compare Outputs:
Save different versions of the videos and compare the results to understand how different prompts produce varying styles, sequences, and video qualities.

# Input and Output :


## video 1:


## prompt :

```


“Create a dramatic cinematic video of a large circular stadium-like building during a thunderstorm. Show dark storm clouds,
 lightning strikes illuminating the sky, and a moody teal-green color tone. Include slow camera movement—starting with a wide 
 shot of the building’s unique lattice structure and lush greenery in the foreground. Add rain ambience, dramatic lighting flashes,
 and a slightly ominous atmosphere. The scene should feel intense, high-contrast, and visually powerful, like a movie trailer shot.”

## video 2:


## prompt :


```

"A young man gracefully skating across the sky as if it were a frozen glass surface. Soft white clouds swirl beneath him,
 and the sunlight creates shimmering reflections with every movement. The man performs smooth, fluid skating motions, 
leaving behind glowing trails of light. The camera follows him in a cinematic wide-angle shot, slowly orbiting as he glides
 through the vibrant blue sky. The atmosphere feels magical and surreal, with gentle wind effects and floating particles 
adding depth. generate a video based on the prompt"
